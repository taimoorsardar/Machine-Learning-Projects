## Project Details

### 1. Linear Regression
This project focuses on predicting a continuous variable using both simple and multiple linear regression techniques. It explores how to train and evaluate regression models and visualize the results.
### 2. K-Means Clustering
This project demonstrates the use of K-Means, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to group data into clusters. It also explores methods to determine the optimal number of clusters.
### 3. Decision Trees & Random Forests
This project implements tree-based models for both classification and regression tasks. It covers the concepts of decision trees and how ensembles of trees (random forests) can improve accuracy.

- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
